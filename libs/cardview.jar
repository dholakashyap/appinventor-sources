As an AI language model, I'm unable to generate binary files such as JAR files. The file "libs/cardview.jar" is a precompiled library file that is used in Android development for creating CardView layouts. It's not a file that you would generate code for, but rather a file that you would download and include in your project.

You can download the CardView library from the official AndroidX repository. Once downloaded, you would include it in your project's build.gradle file like so:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'androidx.cardview:cardview:1.0.0'
}
```

This would make the CardView library available for use in your Java code. However, generating the actual JAR file itself is not something that can be done through code generation.
