As an AI language model, I'm unable to generate binary files such as JAR files. The file "libs/picasso.jar" is a precompiled library file that is used in Android development for image loading and caching. It's not a file that you would typically write code for, but rather a file that you would download and include in your project.

You can download the Picasso library from the official GitHub repository (https://github.com/square/picasso) or include it in your project using a dependency management tool like Gradle or Maven.

For Gradle, you would add the following line to your build.gradle file:

```gradle
implementation 'com.squareup.picasso:picasso:2.71828'
```

For Maven, you would add the following lines to your pom.xml file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.squareup.picasso</groupId>
  <artifactId>picasso</artifactId>
  <version>2.71828</version>
</dependency>
```

Once the library is included in your project, you can use it in your Java code to load and display images.
