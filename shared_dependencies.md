1. Libraries: Both "cardview.jar" and "picasso.jar" are shared across all the Java files as they provide the necessary functionalities for designing the slider and loading images asynchronously.

2. SliderProperties: This class is likely to be shared across all the Java files as it would contain the properties of the slider such as width, height, border radius, margins, padding, and transition effects.

3. SliderItem: This class would be used in "SliderAdapter.java" and "SliderView.java" to represent each individual image in the slider.

4. SliderAdapter: This class would be used in "SliderView.java" to provide the data for the slider view.

5. SliderCallbacks: This class would be used in "SliderExtension.java", "SliderView.java", and "SliderAdapter.java" to handle events like image selection or completion of image loading.

6. SliderNavigationControls: This class would be used in "SliderView.java" to implement swipe actions for navigation.

7. SliderImageLoadingOptions: This class would be used in "SliderAdapter.java" to customize image loading behavior.

8. SliderAutoplay: This class would be used in "SliderView.java" to enable automatic slideshow functionality.

9. SliderImageCaptions: This class would be used in "SliderItem.java" and "SliderAdapter.java" to add captions or text overlays to individual images.

10. XML Layout Files: "slider_item.xml" and "slider_view.xml" would be used in "SliderView.java" and "SliderAdapter.java" to define the layout of the slider and its items.

11. DOM Element IDs: IDs for the slider view and individual slider items would be defined in the XML layout files and used in the Java files to reference these elements.

12. Function Names: Functions for setting and getting properties, handling events, loading images, navigating through the slider, etc., would be defined in the respective Java files and used across multiple files.
